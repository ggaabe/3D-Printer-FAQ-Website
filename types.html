<h1 class="info">Different Types of 3D Printing</h1>

<h2 class="info">3D Printing</h2>
<p class="info">3D printing is an inexact name, but usually refers to object made using ink jet technology in three dimensions. As its name implies it is a close cousin to traditional 2D printing. These printers work by layering a powder substrate and binding it with pigmented glue. This is the only 3D printing technology capable of printing in full color.</p>

<h2 class="info">Selective Laser Sinthering Printers</h2> 
<p class="info">
Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is an additive rapid manufacturing (or 3D Printing) process that builds three dimensional parts by using a laser to selectively sinter (heat and fuse) a powdered material. The printing process begins with a 3D CAD file which is mathematically sliced into 2D cross-sections. The SLS prototype or part is built a layer at a time until completed.

<h2 class="info">Direct Metal Laser Sintering Printers</h2>
<p class="info">Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is an additive manufacturing technology that produces metal prototype and production parts in a matter of hours. DMLS utilizes a variety of metal and alloy materials to create strong durable parts from 3D CAD data without the need of tooling. Metal parts built with this technology have the design versatility of layer additive manufacturing while possessing the mechanical properties and appearance of metal materials.</p>
