<h2 class="info">Potential Future Uses</h2>
<p class="info">With 3D printing moving the manufacturing of our goods from abroad straight to our homes, it is important to look at the potential future uses of 3D printers. Let's look at some things we may be able to download and print for ourselves in the not so distant future.</p>

<h3 class = "info">Printed Organs</h3>
<img src="images/3Dear.jpg" class="futureuses"/>
<p class ="info">With the advent of 3D printing, scientists all over the world are working on different applications for it to produce artificial organs. Because 3D printing allows you to quickly produce any custom shape without a lab, people are looking at making custom 3D printed organs a reality.</p>
<h3 class="info">Electronics</h3>

<p class ="info">Some advanced 3D printers already allow for the printing of electronics, and some 3D printed components, like the ones shown above have already been sent in space! The components shown were launched on November 19th, 2013. The hope is that one day, 3D printers can be sent into space themselves, and astronauts will be able to print any special electronic component they need for any purpose.</p>
<h3 class="info">Food</h3>

<p class="info">Does 3D printed food sound good to be true? Above, are images taken of a pizza produced by a food 3D printer, known as the Foodini. The Foodini can completely print all sorts of foods, from a finished cheeseburger, to an intricately shaped chocolate tree.</p>
